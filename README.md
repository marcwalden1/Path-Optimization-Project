# Path-Optimization-Project


### Abstract
Accessibility for the physically disabled is a prevalent issue at UCLA where stairs and steep slopes make navigating campus arduous. In this project, we aim to model integral parts of UCLA campus and simulate the paths a wheelchair user and a control non-disabled individual would take. Using travel time as the primary metric, we develop two algorithms, Dijkstra’s and least-resistance, to find optimal paths from selected nodes. We demonstrate how wheelchair users are dramatically inconvenienced by the lack of accommodations and inefficient ramps which increase their travel times to as much as 6 times the control. We seek to expand the model’s scope and improve its accuracy in addition to proposing engineering solutions to make campus more accessible for the physi-
cally disabled.


### Problem Description
Westwood is notoriously hilly and the University of California Los Angeles was subsequently designed with many stairs and steep pathways to optimize the area. This often makes the campus inaccessible to physically disabled students who attempt to navigate primarily through elevators or moderate inclines. Some integral halls and centers are entirely out of reach for wheelchair users and many more require lengthy detours. Physically disabled students comprise 2.1% of the 40,000 students at UCLA. Moreover, the influx of students using wheeled transport, including electric scooters and skateboards, has made campus accessibility an increasingly salient issue. UCLA is one of the largest public universities, hosting countless clubs, sports events, international speakers, performing arts, etc., and accommodating these populations is necessary for UCLA to encourage attendance and visitation regardless of physical ability.

This project aims to identify and access areas of inaccessibility on UCLA’s
campus, focusing on the most populated routes. For routes that don’t support
wheelchair users, we propose efficient ramps or similar solutions that would not
unreasonably inconvenience disabled students. To highlight inefficient detours,we map UCLA’s most populated routes, using travel time as a metric of comparison between a simulated wheelchair individual and a non-disabled individual. This enables us to depict where UCLA’s campus struggles with wheel accessibility by analyzing large disparities in travel time between the two test subjects. With this data, we can propose efficient alternatives that wheelchair users could leverage in lieu of stairs or steep inclines. For the current state of campus, we use path optimization to calculate the fastest and most efficient routes for disabled individuals for any given destination. The results of the project will promote inclusivity and equal opportunity for education regardless of physical ability.
